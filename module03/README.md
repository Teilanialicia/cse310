# Overview

This software is my first introduction to pygame.

My purpose in creating this is I wanted to create a fun game while also being exposed to a game framework for the first time.

# Development Environment

To create this, I used the Python interpreter and Pygame library. I also used Visual Studio Code as my IDE.

I built this software using python and pygame.
