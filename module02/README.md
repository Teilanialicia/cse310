# Overview

This software is my first introduction to SQLite. It is a recipe app that uses a SQLite database to store, retrieve, update and delete recipes.

My purpose in creating this is to create an app that interacts with a database in a meaningful way.

# Development Environment

To create this, I used the Python interpreter. I also used Visual Studio Code as my IDE.

I built this software using python.
